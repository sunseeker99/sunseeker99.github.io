Welcome to my website! I’m Yiwei Sun.

I’m currently a modeler working in the field of card portfolio credit risk at Discover. My team develops cutting-edge machine learning models that help manage portfolio risk by making data-driven decisions, such as optimizing customer credit lines.

I gained a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology and Cognitive Science from Peking University and a Master’s in Data Science from Georgia Tech. This blend allows me to approach data problems with both analytical depth and a human-centered mindset.

I’m deeply passionate about using data to solve real-world problems and drive meaningful outcomes. I’m particularly intrigued by how advanced analytics can uncover hidden patterns, shape strategies, and improve decisions. Beyond work, I’m a lifelong learner, constantly seeking new knowledge in areas including software development and machine learning. I enjoy sharing my insights with others — whether through mentoring, writing these posts, or creating intuitive visualizations that make complex concepts accessible.

Outside of my professional life, I have a range of interests that keep me inspired. I love traveling, diving into books on various topics, and cooking. Recently I’ve been learning to improve my money management skills, from differences between various retirement accounts to credit card applications.

I created this website as a space to share my journey, from professional projects to personal explorations. Feel free to dive into my posts, check out my portfolio, or connect with me!
