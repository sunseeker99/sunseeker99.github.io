Traffic accidents have a significant impact on society, influencing public safety, healthcare costs, and infrastructure planning. Effective visualization of accident data using geographic information systems can greatly enhance our ability to address these issues.  

This project focuses on creating interactive visualizations of U.S. traffic accidents using Javascript D3 and Tableau. These tools provide insights into critical patterns, such as accident frequency by state and county, time-of-day trends, and accident severity.  

The dataset for this project comes from a comprehensive Kaggle source, encompassing various features like accident severity, location, time, and environmental conditions.  

## Project Highlights  

- **State and County Accident Comparison:**  
  Visualize and compare the number of accidents across states and counties. Hovering over an area on the map reveals detailed statistics about that region.  

- **Real-World Map Overlay:**  
  Accidents are displayed on an interactive county-level map, offering a clear geographical context.  

- **Accident Hotspot Identification:**  
  K-Means clustering is used to group and highlight locations with high accident frequencies. These clusters are visually displayed on the map for easy identification.  

- **Interactive Regional Statistics:**  
  Users can click buttons to filter and display regional accident statistics, enabling a tailored exploration experience.
